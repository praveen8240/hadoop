 Hive
Example 1: Create a Hive Database
sql
CREATE DATABASE mydb;
SHOW DATABASES;
USE mydb;
Example 2: Create a Table
sql

CREATE TABLE employees (
    id INT,
    name STRING,
    age INT,
    department STRING
) ROW FORMAT DELIMITED
FIELDS TERMINATED BY ','
STORED AS TEXTFILE;
âœ… This table is stored as a text file in HDFS.

Example 3: Load Data into Hive Table
First, create a CSV file (e.g., employees.csv):


1,John,30,HR
2,Alice,28,IT
3,Bob,35,Finance
Upload it to HDFS:

sh

hdfs dfs -mkdir /user/hive/warehouse
hdfs dfs -put employees.csv /user/hive/warehouse/
Load data into Hive:

sql

LOAD DATA INPATH '/user/hive/warehouse/employees.csv' INTO TABLE employees;
Example 4: Query Data
sql

SELECT * FROM employees;
SELECT name, department FROM employees WHERE age > 30;
